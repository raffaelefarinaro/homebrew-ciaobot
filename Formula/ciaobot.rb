      To finish setting up Ciaobot, run:

        ciao run

      and open http://localhost:8443 in your browser. The setup wizard asks
      for a workspace folder (default ~/ciaobot) and a model provider, then
      writes the config and installs the Ciaobot menu bar app and background
      server. Afterwards, open Ciaobot anytime from the menu bar icon or
      /Applications/Ciaobot.app.

      For scripted or headless setups, skip the wizard with:

        ciao setup --workspace <dir>
    CAVEATS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "usage:", shell_output("#{bin}/ciao --help")
  end
