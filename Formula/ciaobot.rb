    <<~CAVEATS
      Finish setup with `ciao run`, then open http://localhost:8443 and
      follow the wizard: it asks for a workspace folder and a model
      provider, then installs the menu bar app and background server.
      Afterwards, open Ciaobot from the menu bar icon or Ciaobot Server.app.

      Scripted or headless setups can skip the wizard:

        ciao setup --workspace <dir>
    CAVEATS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "usage:", shell_output("#{bin}/ciao --help")
  end
end
